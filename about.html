                    <p>The CareToClean, launched on 2nd October 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is more than just a cleanliness drive; it's a national movement aimed at creating a clean and hygienic India. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a clean India, the mission seeks to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on sanitation.</p>
                    <p>Our vision is to create a clean, healthy, and prosperous India where every citizen contributes to maintaining cleanliness in their surroundings. We believe that a clean environment is fundamental to the well-being and dignity of every individual.</p>
                    <p>The campaign has two sub-missions: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Gramin) for rural areas and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Urban) for urban areas. Both aim to achieve their objectives through various initiatives, including community participation, awareness campaigns, and infrastructure development.</p>

            <h2>Impact and Achievements</h2>
            <p>Since its inception, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has made significant strides. Millions of toilets have been constructed, leading to a drastic reduction in open defecation. The focus on solid waste management has also led to better waste collection and processing in many areas.</p>
            <p>Beyond infrastructure, the campaign has successfully instilled a sense of responsibility and awareness among citizens regarding cleanliness. Community-led initiatives and public participation have been key to its success, transforming it from a government program into a people's movement.</p>
