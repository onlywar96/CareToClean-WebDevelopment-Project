        <h2>CareToClean</h2>
        <p>The CareToClean(C2C) or Clean India Mission is a nation-wide campaign in India for the period 2014 to 2019 that aims to clean up the streets, roads, and infrastructure of India's cities, towns, and rural areas. The campaign's objectives include eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountable mechanism of monitoring toilet use.</p>
        <p>Led by the Government of India, the mission aims to achieve an "open-defecation free" (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, by constructing 90 million toilets in rural India at an estimated cost of ₹1.96 lakh crore (US$28 billion).</p>
